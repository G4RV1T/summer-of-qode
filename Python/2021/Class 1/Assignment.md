# Assignment

This file contains all the assignments for this particular class. Students are required to solve each problem with Python and submit the code.

## Class Assignments

* [ ] Input 2 integers from the user and print their product
* [ ] Input an integer and print the remainder when it is divided by n, where n is any natural number
* [ ] Input 2 integers from the user, divide them and store the answer in another variable. Then, print the value of the variable without a decimal point.

## Solutions

### Question 1

```python
# Inputting the numbers and converting int type
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculating product
product = number1 * number2

# Printing Result
print("The product of the two numbers is", product)
```

### Question 2

```python
# Inputting number
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
n = int(input("Enter the number to divde by: "))

# Calculating Remainder
remainder = num % n

# Printing Result
print("The remainder of", num, "divided by", n "is", remainder)
```

### Question 3

```python
# Inputting the numbers and converting int type
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculating Result
result = number1 / number 2

# To remove decimal point we convert to float
result = int(result)

# Printing Result
print("The value of", number1, "divided by", number2, "without a decimal point is", result)
```
